        <p>It's a terrible thing when a giant robot rampages in your city. It's even worse when it's your fault.</p>
        <p>&#147;Santat and Barnett collaborate seamlessly on this slapstick adventure about a pigtailed, bespectacled science fair entrant trying unsuccessfully to control her prize-winning robot... Barnett's telegraphic text packs wicked humor into economical, comic book-style lines, while Santat's skylines pay homage to old monster movies... Blueprints for the robot and the genetically altered toad she deploys to defeat it are included on the endpapers, but, kids, don't try this at home!&#148; &mdash; Publishers Weekly (Starred Review)</p>
        <p>&#147;Santat's brilliantly hued digital illustrations are the perfect foil for Barnett's almost-wordless tale of a science project gone awry... Comic-book, picture-book and movie styles come together in a well-designed package that includes a movie poster on the reverse side of the jacket, an old-time computation book as the inside cover and detailed scientific drawings on the endpapers... A must-have.&#148; &mdash; Kirkus Reviews (Starred Review)</p>
