          Billy Twitters and His Blue Whale Problem
        </div>
        <div class='body'>
          <p>Illustrated by Adam Rex</p>
          <p>A blue whale is longer than 30 dogs lined up nose to tail. Its tongue weighs as much as 400 cats. Blue whales make terrible pets. Just ask Billy Twitters.</p>
          <p>&#147;Definitely funny and slyly subversive&#148; &mdash; Kirkus Reviews (Starred Review)</p>

          <p>&#147;A headlong plunge into surrealism ensues when Billy Twitters's parents punish him by giving him a blue whale. The cleverness is in the idea's literal-mindedness &ndash; Billy thinking &#147;I feel like something's watching me&#148; as he eats his cereal, one very large eye visible behind him, and then hauling the whale to school on his bicycle. It's not supposed to make sense, and, amusingly, it doesn't.&#148; &mdash; <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/books/review/Bookshelf-text1.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=mac%20barnett&amp;st=cse'>The New York Times</a></p>
