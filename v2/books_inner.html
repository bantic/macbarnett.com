          <p>Twelve emerald-encrusted numbers are buried across this country. The only way to find them is by reading this book.</p>
          
          <p>&#147;Ready to get your mind blown? Then dig into this.&#148; &mdash; Daniel Kraus, Booklist (Starred Review) </p>

          <p>&#147;A marvel.... Clock is a house-shaped board book chock full of mystery, humor and stunning artwork. Oh, and there are also clues that point to 12 emerald-encrusted numbers buried across the country, just in case the visuals don't hook you (which is unlikely).&#148; &mdash; Aidin Vaziri, San Francisco Chronicle </p>

          <p>&#147;Enter the world's weirdest book. I'm sure there are other words for it, but the term 'weird' sticks out prominently in my mind. So too do the words 'wacky,' 'hypnotic,' 'awe-inspiring,' and 'potentially hazardous to your health.' I do not kid. I kid a tiny bit. But the fact of the matter is that if you or a child or you AND a child ever wanted to be a part of a real world treasure hunt, the time is now. For my part, all that I care is that there's a new book out there with teeny tiny pictures for me to stare glazed-eye at for long periods of time. To stare and stare and stare.... what I really came to like and respect about The Clock Without a Face is that it has no difficulty defining its own audience. The writing and the pictures are hugely kid-friendly. Maybe a child wouldn't have the wherewithal to solve the puzzles, but there's always a chance. And where there's a chance there will be kid fans. I know I'll be handing my copy to the kids in the bookclub I run with the hope that they find a way to solve it themselves. Because even if they don't solve it, they're going to have a heckuva great time obsessing over its wackiness. Fun fun fun.&#148; &mdash; Elizabeth Bird, School Library Journal</p>

          <p>&#147;Clock seamlessly blends the playfulness of the kids' books we wished we had and the sophistication of [McSweeney's] trademark design.&#148; &mdash; Jonathan Messinger, TimeOut Chicago </p>

          <p>&#147;Fun shape, fun story, fun pictures! If I had a kid who asked a million questions all the time, I would give them this, because it would shut them up for awhile. (Would probably also work on adults who need to be shut up.)&#148; &mdash; Large Hearted Boy</p>

          <p>&#147;Part The Westing Game, part Masquerade, this board book mystery lures readers in with its pentagonal shape, dry humor, and pages of intricate details. But the chief draw is the promise of very real buried treasure, with the clues to its locations hidden within the book...Given the potential of discovering clues to where the actual bejeweled numbers (created by jewelry designer Anna Sheffield) have been hidden, kids should be plenty motivated to pore over each scene.&#148; &mdash; Publishers Weekly</p>

          <p>&#147;The Clock Without a Face is the realization of every (inner) child's wildest dreams: a full color, illustrated mystery book packed full of clues that lead to real treasure.&#148; &mdash; Bonnie Chan, Flavorpill</p>

          <p>&#147;This is a very cool book for the tween set (think 9-12). And really, any teens or adults that have browsed the book in my living room seem to love it just as much.&#148; &mdash; DesignMom</p>

          <p>It's a terrible thing when a giant robot rampages in your city. It's even worse when it's your fault.</p>
          <p>&#147;Santat and Barnett collaborate seamlessly on this slapstick adventure about a pigtailed, bespectacled science fair entrant trying unsuccessfully to control her prize-winning robot... Barnett's telegraphic text packs wicked humor into economical, comic book-style lines, while Santat's skylines pay homage to old monster movies... Blueprints for the robot and the genetically altered toad she deploys to defeat it are included on the endpapers, but, kids, don't try this at home!&#148; &mdash; Publishers Weekly (Starred Review)</p>
          <p>&#147;Santat's brilliantly hued digital illustrations are the perfect foil for Barnett's almost-wordless tale of a science project gone awry... Comic-book, picture-book and movie styles come together in a well-designed package that includes a movie poster on the reverse side of the jacket, an old-time computation book as the inside cover and detailed scientific drawings on the endpapers... A must-have.&#148; &mdash; Kirkus Reviews (Starred Review)</p>

          <p>A blue whale is longer than 30 dogs lined up nose to tail. Its tongue weighs as much as 400 cats. Blue whales make terrible pets. Just ask Billy Twitters.</p>
          <p>&#147;Definitely funny and slyly subversive&#148; &mdash; Kirkus Reviews (Starred Review)</p>

          <p>&#147;A headlong plunge into surrealism ensues when Billy Twitters's parents punish him by giving him a blue whale. The cleverness is in the idea's literal-mindedness &ndash; Billy thinking &#147;I feel like something's watching me&#148; as he eats his cereal, one very large eye visible behind him, and then hauling the whale to school on his bicycle. It's not supposed to make sense, and, amusingly, it doesn't.&#148; &mdash; <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/books/review/Bookshelf-text1.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=mac%20barnett&amp;st=cse'>The New York Times</a></p>
